## Internal Training of Test Mining for NTUDAC

**Python**, **Text Mining**

This is a 4 hours training course for cadres of NTUDAC. The training course covers the entire process in text mining, including preprocessing text data with RegEx, keyword extraction, co-occurrence analysis, topic model, and document classification. The main goal of the training course was to meet the requirements of varying levels of programming skills, ensuring every cadre could engage in the training course. This project helped me organize the knowledge about text mining I'd known and learn about using a pre-train BERT model to facilitate the predictive model's performance.

## Construction of Singlish Corpus

**Python**, **HTML5**, **Web Crawler**

To build an unbiased word embedding model specific for Singlish, I found it was necessary to construct a Singlish corpus as     training data. The web crawler was constructed for a Singapore social media: HardwareZone (like PTT in Taiwan) to get post titles and comments on the platform. In this project, I learned how to generate a proxy pool from a free proxy website to avoid the forbidden from HardwareZone.

## Social Contagion Effect in Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios

**Python**, **Server and Client**

The experiment of the social contagion effect followed the paradigm of the typical memory task. The participants needed to learn a series of words through records and respond to the stimulus. To ensure the following stimulation occurred after the participants had responded, I built a server to get the client's response and played records of the next stimulus.

## LetsMeet

**HTML5**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Website**

The website was the final project of the Applications for Computer Programming course. My teammate and I wanted to develop a     website like when2meet (https://www.when2meet.com/),  which can raise new events and share links with people to check everyone's schedule. I was responsible for constructing the main page of the website in this project. To construct a user-friendly interface, I used jQuery selectable object to build the calendar on the time-selecting page.
